# Health-Route-Advisor
A tool to help individuals needing medical care determine if urgent care, primary care, or emergency room is most appropriate.

## **About**
The purpose of Health Route Advisor is to assist individuals who may be experiencing various symptoms but are not sure of the severity or where to seek care. Unnecessary emergency room visits cost both patients and healthcare organizations in many different ways. For non-emergent symptoms and illnesses there are many resources and alternatives to visiting the emergency room. The goal of Health Route Advisor is to collect user input of current symptoms and evaluatae the severity level to determine whether the user will be best served at an urgent care, emergency room, or primary care visit. Health Route Advisor is not a diagnosis tool and ultimately serves only as a helpful suggestion. With that, always seek emergency medical treatment in the case of emergency.
