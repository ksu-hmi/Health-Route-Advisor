# Health-Route-Advisor
A tool to help individuals needing medical care determine if urgent care, primary care, or emergency room is most appropriate.

## **About**
The purpose of Health Route Advisor is to assist individuals who may be experiencing various symptoms but are not sure of the severity or where to seek care. Unnecessary emergency room visits cost both patients and healthcare organizations in many different ways. For non-emergent symptoms and illnesses there are many resources and alternatives to visiting the emergency room. The goal of Health Route Advisor is to collect user input of current symptoms and evaluatae the severity level to determine whether the user will be best served at an urgent care, emergency room, or primary care visit. Health Route Advisor is not a diagnosis tool and ultimately serves only as a helpful suggestion. With that, always seek emergency medical treatment in the case of emergency.

## **Vision**
The motivation for Health Route Advisor is to alleviate the burden of an unnecessary emergency room visit for both patients and healthcare providers. By providing guidance and education on symptoms warranting urgent versus emergency care, individuals can feel more confident in the care that they will receive. Safety, quality, and efficiency are all significant factors in the healthcare industry and, in some cases, it all begins with the patient's decision on when and where to receive care.  

## **How To**
To use the program, simply run the code in Visual Studio Code or in Jupyter Notebook and just follow the prompts. Ideally, the program will continue to be developed so that a mobile application version will be available.
